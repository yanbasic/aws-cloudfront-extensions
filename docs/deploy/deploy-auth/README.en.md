title: Deploy a Lambda@Edge function to authenticate with Cognito
weight: 1
---

In this step, you will find and deploy serverless applications that have been published to the AWS Serverless Application Repository, the application enables authentication with Amazon Cognito for your website.

## Deploy resources from CloudFormation

1. Launch workshop stack by clicking this [link](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=auth-at-edge&templateURL=https://do-not-delete-cloudfront-ext-workshop.s3.amazonaws.com/edge-auth-workshop.template)
   Use the default parameters to deploy the stack, wait until all the stacked are created
2. Go to [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#) and choose **auth-at-edge** stack
3. In the Outputs section, it lists all the resources created by the stack, find **CloudFrontDistribution**, **CognitoUserPoolId** and **DemoUrl** in the outputs, we will use them in next steps

## Deploy auth application in SAR

To find and configure an application in the AWS Serverless Application Repository

1. Open [the AWS Serverless Application Repository page](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications)
2. Check **Show apps that create custom IAM roles or resource policies**
3. Search the application name **authentication-with-cognito**, choose the application
4. On the application detail page, paste the Cognito user pool id which copied from the stack outputs, check **I acknowledge that this app creates custom IAM roles**
5. Choose **Deploy**. After the deployment is completed, it will redirect to application over page

## Add a CloudFront Trigger to Run the Function

To configure the CloudFront trigger for your function
1. Choose **Configuration** tab and choose **Triggers** 
2. Add Trigger and choose **CloudFront**, choose **Deploy to Lambda@Edge**

3. On the **Deploy to Lambda@Edge** page, enter the following information:

   - Distribution

     The CloudFront distribution which has been created in the stack
    
   - Cache behavior
     
     Select **private/***

   - CloudFront event

     In the drop-down list, choose **Viewer Request**

   Choose **Deploy**

4. Wait for the function to replicate. This typically takes several minutes

   You can check to see if replication is finished by going to the [CloudFront console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) and viewing your distribution. Wait for the distribution status to change from In Progress back to **Deployed**, which means that your function has been replicated

## Test the function

1. Open the DemoUrl which is shown in the stack outputs
2. To verify that Lambda@Edge is protecting the private content and blocking unauthorized requests, click on **Retrieve Private Data** button. You should see an alert dialog popup noting that Lambda@Edge has blocked your access as you have not logged in

3. To gain access to private data, you have to authenticate first. Click **Authenticate with Amazon Cognito** button, you will be presented with Amazon Cognito Custom UI

4. Enter your username and password if you have one, or else you need to sign up
   Click on Sign up and follow instructions to register a new username, password, and verify your email address. Note that as part of the verification process, you will need to copy the one-time code sent to your email. Once authenticated, your browser will redirect back to the Private Content Viewer page, but this time you will have a JSON Web Token
5. Click on **Retrieve Private Data** button again, and the private content is shown this time
